	# use libiconv instead of the one from libc.  This is required because
	# 1. 'additional_includedir=${prefix}/include' from config/lib-prefix.m4
	#    was appended to CPPFLAGS when searching for liblzma
	# 2. we find iconv support from libc, so no need to add -liconv to LIBS
	# 3. but libiconv header will be included first when compiling gdb/charset.c
	# 4. iconv_open is a macro definition from libiconv header and the real one
	#    is libiconv_open
	# 5. then error would occur when linking gdb because iconv_open is a macro
	#    definition utilizing libiconv_open but the linker was not informed of
	#    this with -liconv
	#
	# We cannot do autoheader fixup because autoconf version of exact 2.64 is required
